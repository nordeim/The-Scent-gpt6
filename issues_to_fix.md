Now carefully review all the project files under the public, controllers and views folder to ensure that they are consistent with the updated public/index.php. then check whether public/index.php is consistent with the project README.md

remember to think deeply and systematically via long chain of thoughts to thoroughly and carefully explore the best possible implementation option to implement your proposed changes, then come up with a detailed action plan before executing according to the plan thus created step-by-step cautiously.

please carefully the current project files to check why the main landing page is only left the header and is not consistent with the design specifications in README.md and the attached task and sample documents?

$ curl -Lk https://the-scent.com/ -o current_landing_page.html

The main landing page should have similar appearance as rendered by the index.html and style.css in the "improved landing page.html" folder. The "improved landing page.html" folder contains sample design for the landing page design that README.md refers to. check why the current landing page current_landing_page.html from the curl output does not meet this UI requirement

Now analyze the current state of the landing page and validate it against the design specifications in the provided documents. Key observations:

1. The current landing page in `home.php` is missing the following sections according to the specifications:
   - Hero section with video background and particles.js
   - Teaser quiz section
   - AOS animation
   - Proper responsive design with Tailwind for smaller devices

2. From `header.php`, check to see whether the required dependencies are loaded:
   - Tailwind CSS
   - Font Awesome icons
   - Particles.js
   - AOS.js

Looking at `views/home.php`:
- It has only the hero section
- Missing testimonial quotes and quiz teaser sections
- Missing particles.js integration
- Missing AOS animations

Do an incremental implementation of the landing page design. Before doing anything, first devise a plan for this:

Plan:
1. Update `home.php` to include all required sections:
   - Keep existing hero section but enhance with proper classes
   - Add product features section after hero
   - Add quiz teaser section
   - Add AOS animation triggers
2. Proper Tailwind classes for responsive design
3. Add particles integration
4. The insert_edit_info tool will make these changes easily.

Now update the `home.php` file to match the design specifications.
