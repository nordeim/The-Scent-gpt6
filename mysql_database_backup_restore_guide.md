Okay, here are the equivalent MySQL commands for performing a full backup (schema + data) of your `the_scent` database and then restoring it onto a backup server.

Remember, the current time is Tuesday, April 15, 2025 at 4:51:12 PM PDT.

**1. Backup (Dump) Command - Including Schema and Data**

This command uses `mysqldump` to create a single `.sql` file containing all the SQL statements needed to recreate the database structure *and* repopulate it with all the data as it exists at the time of the backup.

```bash
mysqldump -h localhost -u root -p --single-transaction --default-character-set=utf8mb4 --routines --triggers --events --databases the_scent > the_scent_full_backup.sql
```

**Command Breakdown:**

* `mysqldump`: The backup utility.
* `-h localhost`: Specifies the database host (source server).
* `-u root`: Specifies the MySQL username. We're using `root` here as it worked reliably for you previously due to necessary privileges (like `PROCESS` and potentially others needed for consistency options). You *could* try `scent_user` if you prefer, as `GRANT ALL ON the_scent.*` *should* include the `SELECT` privilege needed to read data, but `root` is often safer for ensuring all options work.
* `-p`: Prompts securely for the password.
* `--single-transaction`: **Highly Recommended for InnoDB tables.** This option starts a transaction (`BEGIN ... WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT`) before dumping, ensuring that the data is consistent as of a single point in time without locking the tables for the entire duration of the dump. This minimizes impact on a live database.
* `--default-character-set=utf8mb4`: Ensures character set consistency.
* `--routines`, `--triggers`, `--events`: Explicitly includes stored procedures/functions, triggers, and scheduled events in the backup.
* `--databases the_scent`: Specifies the database to dump. Using `--databases` ensures the output file includes `CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS the_scent;` and `USE the_scent;`, making the restore process easier and safer. **Crucially, we *omit* `--no-data` here, so data IS included.**
* `>`: Redirects the output to a file.
* `the_scent_full_backup.sql`: The name of the output file containing both schema and data. This file can become quite large depending on the amount of data.

**To run this:**
Execute the command in your terminal, and enter the `root` password when prompted.

**2. Restore Command**

This command uses the standard `mysql` client on the *target* (backup) server to execute the SQL script created by `mysqldump`, effectively recreating and repopulating the database.

```bash
mysql -h <target_host> -u <admin_user> -p < the_scent_full_backup.sql
```

**Command Breakdown:**

* `mysql`: The command-line client.
* `-h <target_host>`: Specifies the hostname or IP address of the **target backup server**. This might be `localhost` if restoring on the same machine, or a remote address.
* `-u <admin_user>`: Specifies a MySQL username on the **target server** that has sufficient privileges to create databases, tables, routines, triggers, events, and insert data. Often, `root` or a dedicated administrative user is used here.
* `-p`: Prompts securely for the `<admin_user>`'s password on the target server.
* `<`: Redirects input *from* the specified file into the `mysql` client.
* `the_scent_full_backup.sql`: The backup file created in the previous step. The `mysql` client will execute all the SQL commands within this file.

**To run this:**
1.  **Transfer the File:** Copy `the_scent_full_backup.sql` from the source machine to the target backup server (or a location accessible from where you run the `mysql` command).
2.  **Execute:** Run the `mysql` command above in the terminal on the target server (or a machine that can connect to it), replacing `<target_host>` and `<admin_user>` appropriately. Enter the `<admin_user>`'s password when prompted.

**Important Considerations:**

1.  **User Creation (`scent_user`) on Target:** Remember that `mysqldump` **does not** back up MySQL user accounts or global privileges. After restoring the database structure and data using the commands above, you *still* need to manually create the `scent_user` and grant it privileges on the **target server**:
    ```sql
    -- Connect to the target MySQL server as <admin_user> first
    CREATE USER 'scent_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'StrongPassword123'; -- Adjust host ('localhost') if needed
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `the_scent`.* TO 'scent_user'@'localhost'; -- Or specific privileges
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    ```
2.  **Backup File Size:** Full backups including data can be significantly larger than schema-only backups. Ensure you have sufficient disk space.
3.  **Compression (Optional but Recommended):** For large databases, you can compress the backup file during creation and decompress during restore to save disk space and potentially speed up file transfer.
    * **Dump with Compression:**
        ```bash
        mysqldump -h localhost -u root -p --single-transaction --default-character-set=utf8mb4 --routines --triggers --events --databases the_scent | gzip > the_scent_full_backup.sql.gz
        ```
    * **Restore with Decompression:**
        ```bash
        gunzip < the_scent_full_backup.sql.gz | mysql -h <target_host> -u <admin_user> -p
        ```
4.  **Target Server User Privileges:** Ensure the `<admin_user>` on the target server has the necessary privileges (e.g., `CREATE`, `CREATE ROUTINE`, `CREATE VIEW`, `ALTER`, `ALTER ROUTINE`, `INSERT`, `DROP`, `TRIGGER`, `EVENT`, etc.). Using `root` usually covers this.

These commands provide a standard way to perform a full backup and restore of your `the_scent` database using MySQL's built-in command-line tools.
